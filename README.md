# Image-to-text-to-audio
# 📸📝🔊 Image to Text to Audio Converter

This project is a simple pipeline that converts an **image** containing text into **spoken audio**. It uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from the image, then converts that text to speech using a text-to-speech (TTS) engine.

## 🚀 Features

- Extracts text from images using OCR (e.g., Tesseract)
- Converts extracted text to speech using a TTS engine (e.g., pyttsx3 or gTTS)
- Supports various image formats (JPG, PNG, etc.)
- Lightweight and easy to use

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Tesseract OCR** via `pytesseract`
- **Text-to-Speech** via `pyttsx3` or `gTTS`
- **PIL (Pillow)** for image handling
